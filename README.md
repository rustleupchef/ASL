    This is an ASL translator that is made for my Computer Science Project

    It has 5 major hand signs
        Hello
        Yes
        No
        Thanks
        Love you

    Everytime one of these handsigns are made it says the hand sign.

    Theirs also a dictionary feature.

    The dictionary system takes is args1, args2, args3... spoken text
    Each arg is a hand sign, and when those hand signs are made in that order the code says what's in the dictionary.

    The dictionary detection starts with the love you hand signs then you act out the chain of hand signs.
    After all of that is done, you end with the love you hand sign; this results in the phrase being said.
